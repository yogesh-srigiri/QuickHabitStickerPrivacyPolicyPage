<h1>Quick Habit Sticker - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: February 2026</strong></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Quick Habit Sticker ("Application") is a lightweight, offline-first habit tracker. 
This Privacy Policy explains what data the Application processes, where it is stored, 
and how you can contact us about privacy-related requests. This policy is designed 
to meet Google Play Store requirements for transparency on data collection and handling.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>The Application operates primarily offline and, by default, does not collect or transmit personal data to remote servers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>No user accounts or login information</li>
  <li>No emails or contact information collected by the app</li>
  <li>No device identifiers intentionally transmitted</li>
  <li>No IP addresses logged by the app</li>
  <li>No analytics or usage data sent to third parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
<p>
All habit and progress data is stored locally on your device using secure local storage mechanisms. 
This data remains on your device unless removed by you. Device-level backup services may include this data 
depending on your system settings.
</p>

<h2>3. Permissions and Notifications</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used only for local habit reminders if you enable them.</li>
  <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Included for technical compatibility; the app does not transmit personal data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
<p>
The Application uses open‑source libraries such as React Native, Expo, and related community packages. 
These libraries operate within the app and are not used to collect or transmit personal user data.
</p>

<h2>5. Analytics & Crash Reporting</h2>
<p>
The Application does not include analytics, tracking, or crash‑reporting services that collect personal data.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing & Sale</h2>
<p>
We do not share, sell, or rent personal information to third parties.
</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<p>
Data is stored locally on your device. We recommend keeping your device secure with system updates 
and screen‑lock protection.
</p>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children and is safe for general audiences.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
You can delete all stored data by clearing app storage or uninstalling the Application from your device.
</p>

<h2>10. Legal Rights</h2>
<p>
Depending on your location, you may have rights under privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA. 
Because the app stores data only locally and does not collect personal data centrally, 
requests can typically be fulfilled by clearing local app data.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be reflected by revising the 
"Last Updated" date above.
</p>

<h2>12. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have privacy-related questions or requests, contact:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email: yogeshsrigiri8@gmail.com</li>
  <li>Developer: Yogesh Srigiri</li>
</ul>
